The `MicrobiomeStat` package is a state-of-the-art R tool with a
**special focus on the analysis of longitudinal microbiome data**. While
capable of handling multi-omics data and cross-sectional studies, its
**core strength lies in its proficiency in longitudinal analysis**. This
makes it an invaluable resource for researchers conducting extensive
biological studies over time.

# Citations

## General Citation for MicrobiomeStat

If you are using features beyond the `linda` and `linda.plot` functions,
please cite as follows, until a preprint version is published:

    @Manual{,
      title = {MicrobiomeStat: Comprehensive Statistical and Visualization Methods for Microbiome and Multi-Omics Data},
      author = {Xianyang Zhang and Jun Chen and Caffery(Chen) Yang},
      year = {2023},
      note = {R package version 1.1.1},
      url = {www.microbiomestat.wiki},
    }

## Citation for Specialized `MicrobiomeStat` Functions

If you are using the `linda`, `linda.plot`,
`generate_taxa_association_test_long`, `generate_taxa_test_pair`,
`generate_taxa_test_single`, or `generate_taxa_trend_test_long`
functions, please cite the following paper:

    @article{zhou2022linda,
      title={LinDA: linear models for differential abundance analysis of microbiome compositional data},
      author={Zhou, Huijuan and He, Kejun and Chen, Jun and Zhang, Xianyang},
      journal={Genome biology},
      volume={23},
      number={1},
      pages={1--23},
      year={2022},
      publisher={BioMed Central}
    }

We will update the citation guidelines as soon as the preprint is
published.

## Important Note on CRAN Version

Due to the **ongoing development cycle**, the **most up-to-date
features** of `MicrobiomeStat` have **not yet been uploaded to the CRAN
repository**. The current CRAN version **only supports the `linda` and
`linda.plot` functions**. If you **require additional functionalities**,
particularly for **analyzing longitudinal data**, we recommend
**installing the development version from GitHub**. To do this, youâ€™ll
first need to **install the `devtools` package** if you havenâ€™t already:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once `devtools` is installed, you can install `MicrobiomeStat` from
GitHub using the following command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("cafferychen777/MicrobiomeStat")
```
