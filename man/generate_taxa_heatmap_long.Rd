\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A list object in a format specific to MicrobiomeStat, which can include components such as feature.tab (matrix), feature.ann (matrix), meta.dat (data.frame), tree, and feature.agg.list (list).}

\item{subject.var}{A character string specifying the subject variable in the metadata.}

\item{time.var}{A character string specifying the time variable in the metadata.}

\item{t0.level}{Character or numeric, baseline time point for longitudinal analysis, e.g. "week_0" or 0. Required.}

\item{ts.levels}{Character vector, names of follow-up time points, e.g. c("week_4", "week_8"). Required.}

\item{group.var}{A character string specifying the grouping variable in the metadata. Default is NULL.}

\item{strata.var}{A character string specifying the stratification variable in the metadata. Default is NULL.}

\item{feature.level}{A character vector specifying the taxa level(s) to include in the analysis. Default is c('Phylum', 'Family', 'Genus').}

\item{feature.dat.type}{The type of the feature data, which determines how the data is handled in downstream analyses.
Should be one of:
- "count": Raw count data, will be normalized by the function.
- "proportion": Data that has already been normalized to proportions/percentages.
- "other": Custom abundance data that has unknown scaling. No normalization applied.
The choice affects preprocessing steps as well as plot axis labels.
Default is "count", which assumes raw OTU table input.}

\item{features.plot}{A character vector specifying which feature IDs (e.g. OTU IDs) to plot.
Default is NULL, in which case features will be selected based on `top.k.plot` and `top.k.func`.}

\item{top.k.plot}{A numeric value specifying the number of top taxa to be plotted if features.plot is NULL. If NULL (default), all taxa will be plotted.}

\item{top.k.func}{A function to compute the top k taxa if features.plot is NULL. If NULL (default), the mean function will be used.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum prevalence threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with prevalence below this value will be removed.
Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples where the taxon is present.
Default 0 removes no taxa by prevalence filtering.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum abundance threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with mean abundance below this value will be removed.
Abundance refers to counts or proportions depending on \code{feature.dat.type}.
Default 0 removes no taxa by abundance filtering.}

\item{base.size}{Base font size for the generated plots.}

\item{palette}{Color palette used for the plots.}

\item{cluster.cols}{A logical variable indicating if columns should be clustered. Default is FALSE.}

\item{cluster.rows}{A logical variable indicating if rows should be clustered. Default is TRUE.}

\item{pdf}{A logical value. If TRUE (default), saves the plot as a PDF file. If FALSE, the plot will be displayed interactively without creating a PDF.}

\item{file.ann}{(Optional) A character string specifying a file annotation to include in the generated PDF file's name.}

\item{pdf.wid}{Width of the PDF plots.}

\item{pdf.hei}{Height of the PDF plots.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to be passed to the pheatmap() function from the “pheatmap” package.}
}
\value{
An object of class pheatmap, the generated heatmap plot
}
\description{
This function performs hierarchical clustering on microbiome data based on grouping
variables and strata variables in sample metadata and generates stacked heatmaps
using the “pheatmap” package. It can also save the resulting heatmap as a PDF file.
