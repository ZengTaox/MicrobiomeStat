\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A list object in a format specific to MicrobiomeStat, which can include components such as feature.tab (matrix), feature.ann (matrix), meta.dat (data.frame), tree, and feature.agg.list (list). The data.obj can be converted from other formats using several functions from the MicrobiomeStat package, including: 'mStat_convert_DGEList_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_DESeqDataSet_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_SummarizedExperiment_to_data_obj', 'mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_mothur_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_dada2_as_data_obj', and 'mStat_import_biom_as_data_obj'. Alternatively, users can construct their own data.obj. Note that not all components of data.obj may be required for all functions in the MicrobiomeStat package.}

\item{subject.var}{A character string defining the subject variable in meta_tab.
This should be a column that contains unique subject IDs to
identify each sample's subject of origin. Required for plotting
individual subject lines.}

\item{time.var}{A character string defining the time variable in meta_tab.
This should be a column in meta_tab that represents the time
points for the longitudinal samples. Required to identify
the time axis for plotting.}

\item{t0.level}{Character or numeric, baseline time point for longitudinal analysis, e.g. "week_0" or 0. Required.}

\item{ts.levels}{Character vector, names of follow-up time points, e.g. c("week_4", "week_8"). Required.}

\item{group.var}{A character string defining the grouping variable in meta_tab.
This variable is used for coloring lines in the plot and faceting by
group. For example, variable could be treatment group. Optional,
can be set to NULL.}

\item{strata.var}{(Optional) A character string defining the stratification variable
in meta_tab. This variable is used for nested faceting in the plot.
For example, could be clinical strata like disease status.
Optional, can be set to NULL. When set, plot will show nested
facetting by strata within each feature.}

\item{feature.level}{The column name(s) in the feature annotation matrix (feature.ann) of data.obj
to use for summarization and plotting. Can be taxonomic levels like "Phylum",
"Genus", or any other annotation columns like "OTU_ID". Should be a character
vector specifying one or more column names in feature.ann. The special value
"original" can also be provided, which will use the original row names from
feature.ann. Multiple columns can be provided, and data will be plotted
separately for each column. **\bold{Cannot be NULL, as NULL value will lead to errors.}**}

\item{feature.dat.type}{The type of the feature data, which determines how the data is handled in downstream analyses.
Should be one of:
- "count": Raw count data, will be normalized by the function.
- "proportion": Data that has already been normalized to proportions/percentages.
- "other": Custom abundance data that has unknown scaling. No normalization applied.
The choice affects preprocessing steps as well as plot axis labels.
Default is "count", which assumes raw OTU table input.}

\item{features.plot}{A character vector specifying which feature IDs (e.g. OTU IDs) to plot.
Default is NULL, in which case features will be selected based on `top.k.plot` and `top.k.func`.}

\item{top.k.plot}{Integer specifying number of top k features to plot, when `features.plot` is NULL.
Default is NULL, in which case all features passing filters will be plotted.}

\item{top.k.func}{Function to use for selecting top k features, when `features.plot` is NULL.
Options include inbuilt functions like "mean", "sd", or a custom function. Default is NULL, in which
case features will be selected by abundance.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum prevalence threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with prevalence below this value will be removed.
Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples where the taxon is present.
Default 0 removes no taxa by prevalence filtering.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum abundance threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with mean abundance below this value will be removed.
Abundance refers to counts or proportions depending on \code{feature.dat.type}.
Default 0 removes no taxa by abundance filtering.}

\item{base.size}{Base font size for the generated plots.}

\item{theme.choice}{Plot theme choice. Can be one of:
  - "prism": ggprism::theme_prism()
  - "classic": theme_classic()
  - "gray": theme_gray()
  - "bw": theme_bw()
Default is "bw".}

\item{custom.theme}{A custom ggplot theme provided as a ggplot2 theme object. This allows users to override the default theme and provide their own theme for plotting. To use a custom theme, first create a theme object with ggplot2::theme(), then pass it to this argument. For example:

```r
my_theme <- ggplot2::theme(
  axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size=16, color="red"),
  legend.position = "none"
)
```

Then pass `my_theme` to `custom.theme`. Default is NULL, which will use the default theme based on `theme.choice`.}

\item{palette}{Color palette to use for mapping groups to colors in the plot. Must be a
character vector of colors. Default palette will be used if NULL.
If specified, should be same length as number of groups/levels in
group.var. Colors will be mapped to groups in order of levels.}

\item{pdf}{A logical value. If TRUE (default), saves the plot as a PDF file. If FALSE, the plot will be displayed interactively without creating a PDF.}

\item{file.ann}{(Optional) A character string specifying a file annotation to include in the generated PDF file's name.}

\item{pdf.wid}{Width of the PDF plots.}

\item{pdf.hei}{Height of the PDF plots.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to be passed.}
