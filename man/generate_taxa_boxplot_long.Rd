\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A list object in a format specific to MicrobiomeStat, which can include components such as feature.tab (matrix), feature.ann (matrix), meta.dat (data.frame), tree, and feature.agg.list (list). The data.obj can be converted from other formats using several functions from the MicrobiomeStat package, including: 'mStat_convert_DGEList_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_DESeqDataSet_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_SummarizedExperiment_to_data_obj', 'mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_mothur_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_dada2_as_data_obj', and 'mStat_import_biom_as_data_obj'. Alternatively, users can construct their own data.obj. Note that not all components of data.obj may be required for all functions in the MicrobiomeStat package.}

\item{subject.var}{A string indicating the variable for subject identifiers.}

\item{time.var}{A string indicating the variable for time points.}

\item{t0.level}{Character or numeric, baseline time point for longitudinal analysis, e.g. "week_0" or 0. Required.}

\item{ts.levels}{Character vector, names of follow-up time points, e.g. c("week_4", "week_8"). Required.}

\item{group.var}{A string indicating the variable for group identifiers. Default is NULL.}

\item{strata.var}{A string indicating the variable for strata identifiers. Default is NULL.}

\item{feature.level}{A string indicating the taxonomic level to plot.}

\item{feature.dat.type}{The type of the feature data, which determines how the data is handled in downstream analyses.
Should be one of:
- "count": Raw count data, will be normalized by the function.
- "proportion": Data that has already been normalized to proportions/percentages.
- "other": Custom abundance data that has unknown scaling. No normalization applied.
The choice affects preprocessing steps as well as plot axis labels.
Default is "count", which assumes raw OTU table input.}

\item{features.plot}{A character vector specifying which feature IDs (e.g. OTU IDs) to plot.
Default is NULL, in which case features will be selected based on `top.k.plot` and `top.k.func`.}

\item{top.k.plot}{Integer specifying number of top k features to plot, when `features.plot` is NULL.
Default is NULL, in which case all features passing filters will be plotted.}

\item{top.k.func}{Function to use for selecting top k features, when `features.plot` is NULL.
Options include inbuilt functions like "mean", "sd", or a custom function. Default is NULL, in which
case features will be selected by abundance.}

\item{transform}{A string indicating the transformation to apply to the data before plotting. Options are:
- "identity": No transformation (default)
- "sqrt": Square root transformation
- "log": Logarithmic transformation. Zeros are replaced with half of the minimum non-zero value for each taxon before log transformation.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum prevalence threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with prevalence below this value will be removed.
Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples where the taxon is present.
Default 0 removes no taxa by prevalence filtering.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum abundance threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with mean abundance below this value will be removed.
Abundance refers to counts or proportions depending on \code{feature.dat.type}.
Default 0 removes no taxa by abundance filtering.}

\item{base.size}{A numeric value specifying the base size of the plot. Default is 16.}

\item{theme.choice}{Plot theme choice. Can be one of:
  - "prism": ggprism::theme_prism()
  - "classic": theme_classic()
  - "gray": theme_gray()
  - "bw": theme_bw()
Default is "bw".}

\item{custom.theme}{A custom ggplot theme provided as a ggplot2 theme object. This allows users to override the default theme and provide their own theme for plotting. To use a custom theme, first create a theme object with ggplot2::theme(), then pass it to this argument. For example:

```r
my_theme <- ggplot2::theme(
  axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size=16, color="red"),
  legend.position = "none"
)
```

Then pass `my_theme` to `custom.theme`. Default is NULL, which will use the default theme based on `theme.choice`.}

\item{palette}{A character vector specifying the color palette. Default is NULL.}

\item{pdf}{A logical value indicating whether to save the plot as a PDF. Default is TRUE.}

\item{file.ann}{A string for additional annotation to the file name. Default is NULL.}

\item{pdf.wid}{A numeric value specifying the width of the PDF. Default is 11.}

\item{pdf.hei}{A numeric value specifying the height of the PDF. Default is 8.5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the function.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects for each taxonomic level.

\description{
This function generates boxplots to visualize the taxonomic composition of samples for longitudinal data.
It also provides options for grouping and stratifying data.
}
\details{
This function generates a boxplot of taxa abundances for longitudinal data.
The boxplot can be stratified by a group variable and/or other variables.
It allows for different taxonomic levels to be used and a specific number of features to be included in the plot.
The function also has options to customize the size, theme, and color palette of the plot, and to save the plot as a PDF.
