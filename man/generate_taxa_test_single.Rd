\usage{

  prev.filter = 0,
  abund.filter = 0,

\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A list object in a format specific to MicrobiomeStat, which can include components such as feature.tab (matrix), feature.ann (matrix), meta.dat (data.frame), tree, and feature.agg.list (list). The data.obj can be converted from other formats using several functions from the MicrobiomeStat package, including: 'mStat_convert_DGEList_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_DESeqDataSet_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_SummarizedExperiment_to_data_obj', 'mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_mothur_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_dada2_as_data_obj', and 'mStat_import_biom_as_data_obj'. Alternatively, users can construct their own data.obj. Note that not all components of data.obj may be required for all functions in the MicrobiomeStat package.}

\item{time.var}{Character string specifying the column name in metadata containing time variable.
Used to subset data to a single timepoint if provided. Default NULL does not subset.}

\item{t.level}{Character string specifying the time level/value to subset data to,
if a time variable is provided. Default NULL does not subset data.}

\item{group.var}{Character string specifying the column name in metadata containing grouping
categories. This will be used as the predictor in differential abundance testing.}

\item{adj.vars}{Character vector specifying column names in metadata containing covariates.
These will be used for adjustment in differential abundance testing.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum prevalence threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with prevalence below this value will be removed.
Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples where the taxon is present.
Default 0 removes no taxa by prevalence filtering.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum abundance threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with mean abundance below this value will be removed.
Abundance refers to counts or proportions depending on \code{feature.dat.type}.
Default 0 removes no taxa by abundance filtering.}

\item{feature.level}{The column name in the feature annotation matrix (feature.ann) of data.obj
to use for summarization and plotting. This can be the taxonomic level like "Phylum", or any other
annotation columns like "Genus" or "OTU_ID". Should be a character vector specifying one or more
column names in feature.ann. Multiple columns can be provided, and data will be plotted separately
for each column. Default is NULL, which defaults to all columns in feature.ann if `features.plot`
is also NULL.}

\item{feature.dat.type}{The type of the feature data, which determines how the data is handled in downstream analyses.
Should be one of:
- "count": Raw count data, will be normalized by the function.
- "proportion": Data that has already been normalized to proportions/percentages.
- "other": Custom abundance data that has unknown scaling. No normalization applied.
The choice affects preprocessing steps as well as plot axis labels.
Default is "count", which assumes raw OTU table input.}

\item{feature.sig.level}{A numeric threshold, usually between 0 and 1, for assessing the significance of individual taxa. Default is 0.1.}

\item{feature.mt.method}{A character string specifying the method employed for multiple testing correction (e.g., "fdr" for False Discovery Rate). Default is "fdr".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the ZicoSeq function.}
}
\value{
A list of tibble(s) containing information about significant taxa, including R.Squared, F.Statistic, Estimate, P.Value, Adjusted.P.Value, Mean.Proportion, Mean.Prevalence, SD.Abundance and SD.Prevalence.
}
\description{
This function applies a differential abundance analysis using ZicoSeq on a data set. The function filters taxa based on prevalence and abundance, then it aggregates and applies the ZicoSeq method. Finally, it creates a report of significant taxa with relevant statistics.
}
\details{
This function performs differential abundance analysis using ZicoSeq method:

1. Subset data to specific time point if time variable and level provided.

2. Extract OTU table, taxonomy table, and sample metadata.

3. Filter OTUs by prevalence and abundance thresholds if counting data.

4. Aggregate OTU table to taxonomic levels specified by \code{feature.level}.

5. Run ZicoSeq on aggregated table, with grouping and adjustment variables.

6. Extract and compile statistics for significant taxa into results tables,
including R-squared, F statistic, coefficients, p-values, mean proportions, etc.

7. Return list of tables, with each element corresponding to one taxonomic level.

In summary, it applies preprocessing steps, runs ZicoSeq differential abundance testing,
and compiles informative results tables for significant taxa. Adjustment for covariates is
supported. Customizable taxonomic aggregation allows testing at different levels.
